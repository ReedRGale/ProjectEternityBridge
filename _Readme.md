#Eternity Bridge Outline
Note: This document is only a proposal. It is not the official documentation (yet). I (Joshua Lamusga) am including it here because I believe that there is more value in having a readme associated directly with the project structure so that all information is in one place.

###Rules
1. Documentation edits must receive majority approval from the (actively voting) members of the team.
2. All decisions and proposals will be posted under the appropriate sections here, or they *do not exist*.
3. Feel free to make suggestions to any aspect of the game or documentation.

##Unresolved issues
**Art**  
What will be the resolution of the characters?  
**Design**  
**Programming**  
There is currently no programming style standardization. The scripting language hasn't been set yet.  
**Unorganized**  

##Approved plans
**Art**  
Art will be 2d sprites. There will be 28 grunt enemies and 5 bosses.  
**Design**  
There will be 8 eras and a playable character from each era.  

The game will be 2D. Eternity is the goo-like essence of time and space in this universe, and the 7th-dimensional repercussions of the Eternity Bridge's existence. The 7th dimension comprises all possibilities in any given universe. The Eternity Bridge is a stabilizer that condenses the entirety of the universe's possible timelines into a single continuity. As a result, it prevents time travel from automatically affecting the future. It allows time travel to be reversible such that a journey will have no impact. Time travel is more like physical travel. The timeline of the universe generates auras from the transpiring of similar events, which gravitate towards each other. These events distort the continuum into a spiral. Traveling the bridge will reveal the timeline in this spiraled format, where auras congeal to create orbs revealing similar eras across time.

Eternity Bridge disasters are caused by the transfer of too many auras in rapid succession. This could make bridge travel hard, create hazards along the bridge, permanently make eras impossible to time travel to, or strain the bridge. Breaking the bridge would unwind the continuum and the universe would begin to exist in all states at all times (as the result of infinite possibilities). Only a fast response can fix the bridge and affected areas; otherwise they (and maybe more) are lost.

There are two factions: The Fractals, and the Eternals. Fractals want to break the bridge to create a more fluid timeline where more possibilities are available. They think it promotes change. Eternals believe in pre-destination and that maintaining the bridge is important to the survival of all timelines. They maintain it to prevent apocalypse.

Xem the Oracle: A human with purple eyes and red-brown hair. Initially robed. He is from a magical universe and  can see the eternity bridge. Combat abilities are focused around support and debuffing. One ability converts an enemy to an ally for the battle.

Esperanza: A member of the Fractal faction. In the last five minutes before coming to the bridge, Esperanza was hacking with a longtime partner when something went wrong. The facility guards located the terminal her partner was at. Before she could help, she was abruptly transported to the bridge. She is obsessed with trying to fix her timeline.

Morgan: A member of the Fractal faction.

Luscious: A member of the Eternals faction.

Murlan: A member of the Eternals faction.

Jon: ...

In a steam punk universe, the main character is a young man. The Bridge calls to people to live in its community to prevent it from falling apart. It nabs the main character in this way. You only remember five minutes of your life before the bridge took you. You gather others to help maintain the bridge or destroy the device making it look like a spiral.  

The main character is visited by Xem the Oracle, because Xem notices an anomaly in the Bridge (?).
